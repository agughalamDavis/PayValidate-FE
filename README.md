## PayValidate FE 

This is the documentation for running the front end of the project locally. 

### Steps
* Clone the project from this repo
* Ensure that the API is set up and listening for requests already. [click here to see how to set up the API](https://github.com/agughalamDavis/PayValidate-BE)
* Serve the static files with any server of choice. I recommend the live server extension on VSCODE. The project is now ready for testing.
